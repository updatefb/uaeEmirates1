      <hr noshade color="#800000" size="3">
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There are three strategies 
      that most of us use in finding materials on some piece of research we are 
      working on:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1.&nbsp; Following 
        references back to other work:</b> We look through the 
        documents (books, monographs, articles) that we already know about to 
        find references&nbsp; (footnotes, endnotes, etc., that we just generally 
        call &quot;citations&quot;) made by their authors 
        to other, former works.&nbsp; We get and read those works too, because we assume they 
        will, in some way, are related to the relevant document's content.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">
      <b>2.&nbsp; Bibliographies and indexing services:</b> We search through 
        bibliographies or abstracting/indexing services, using subject words we 
        think are reflective of what it is we are looking for.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">
      <b>3.&nbsp; Consult a subject expert:</b> We talk to a researcher or 
        scholar (maybe the professor who taught us in a related course) who 
        knows the area, and who advises us of what authors/researchers we should 
        be familiar with.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The essential problem with the 
      first two strategies above is that they are only going to point you to 
      research literature that is <i><b>older</b></i> than they themselves are.&nbsp; If you 
      are reading a 1995 article on cognitive dissonance, you just won't find 
      references to more recent literature in it than at least a couple of years before the date of the article that referenced it.&nbsp; It is the 
      same with much of the bibliographic literature too: unless a bibliography 
      is a recurrent publication, or is made available online in a continuously 
      updated fashion, it can not maintain entries for the very, very recently 
      published research materials.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The third method--going to a 
      scholar who keeps up with who is working on what aspects of some topic--is 
      a wonderful way of getting an evaluated assessment of who is now working 
      in the research area, and an assessment of what they are saying in their 
      research.&nbsp; But, it is also the method that is not generally available 
      to most of us.&nbsp; This is a form of inquiry that depends on the 
      requestor's professional/academic relationship with the scholar being queried.&nbsp; 
      A colleague of the scholar will probably be able to get this information, 
      and a student of the scholar might too, but many of us would not: we have 
      no association with the scholar; we are just taking up his or her time.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">But there is another strategy, 
      a fourth technique, that can be employed to locate recent research: citation 
      indexing.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>4.&nbsp; Citation indexing</b> </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Citation indexing makes links 
      between books and articles that were written in the past and articles that make 
      reference to (&quot;cite&quot;) these older publications.&nbsp; In other words, it is a 
      technique that allows us to trace the use of an idea (an earlier document) 
      <i><b>forward</b></i> to others who have used (&quot;cited&quot;) it.&nbsp; The evidence that we 
      take as indicating this &quot;relationship&quot; between earlier research and 
      subsequent research are the references or footnotes or endnotes 
      (citations) in the more recent work.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you will, there is an 
      informational &quot;ancestry&quot; of a current idea as it is expressed in the 
      literature.&nbsp; That ancestry is noted by the author of the current idea 
      (his journal article) through his footnotes--his research report's citations.&nbsp;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, think of the, say, 12 
      citations made in a current journal article about some research topic.&nbsp; 
      Just as there might be four &quot;assigned&quot; subject headings to this current 
      journal article for indexing purposes in some indexing database, we could also find the 12 citations 
      to previous journal articles and books &quot;assigned&quot; as headings  to 
      &quot;index&quot; this article under as well.&nbsp; Were we to do that for all of the 
      current journal articles we are adding to our indexing service, we could 
      look up current articles by subject headings <b><i>or by authors of 
      previously published materials that were cited by more recent articles</i></b>.&nbsp; 
      That is the trick: we tread the citations found in recent articles as 
      &quot;index entries&quot; to be put in our indexing database for retrieval purposes.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">How does this technique change 
      a searcher's strategy for locating information?&nbsp; Well, <i><b>it allows us to 
      follow--forward through time--a concept's or idea's or methodology's use 
      by other scholars</b></i>.&nbsp; You see, what the Institute for 
      Scientific Information (ISI)--the company that makes citation indexing 
      services--does is build a database of current articles coming from 
      thousands of journals that it selects to use for this purpose.&nbsp; For 
      the social sciences, there are something on the order of 8,000 journal 
      titles whose separate issues are analyzed as they are published to see 
      what journal articles are in them.&nbsp; Those journal articles are 
      represented in the graphic below as the light blue boxes, shown as having 
      been published in one of two current years (2002 or 2003).&nbsp; Of 
      course, there are thousands upon thousands of actual articles, but we are 
      only showing a small number for illustration purposes.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">What ISI does is record a 
      &quot;heading&quot; (sort of like a subject heading, but it isn't a subject at all) 
      for each reference or &quot;citation&quot; that these current authors make in their 
      journal articles back to each previously-published article or book.&nbsp; 
      We have highlighted two such previous publications:&nbsp; Smith's 1995 
      article on some topic, and Jones' 1984 article on some other topic.&nbsp; 
      Now here is the important, novel feature of citation indexing:&nbsp;
      </font><b><font face="Arial" size="2">all of the articles or books shown 
      at the bottom of this graphic </b>(the 8 white articles or books)<b> 
      become the indexing access points that you search by in ISI's citation 
      index.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
      <p align="center">
      <img border="1" src="interrelations.jpg" width="438" height="302"></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In other words, if you know 
      that Smith wrote a very important research article on something-or-other 
      in the field of Economics in 1995, you can search ISI's citation index to 
      determine what more recent journal articles have cited her 1995 work. In 
      the example below, we show two journal articles that cited Smith's 1995 
      work--one from 2002, and the other from 2003.&nbsp; That is how citation 
      indexing works: you know about an author (or more specifically, an 
      author's particular book or article that has already been published) and 
      you use ISI's citation index to find out who has cited that work.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" color="#800000">How ISI's Web of 
      Science works</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">ISI calls its whole set of 
      online services the <b><i>Web of Knowledge</i></b>, but you will find it 
      listed under the OU Libraries LORA collection of database services as <i>
      <b>Web of Science</b></i>.&nbsp; When you are correctly authenticated in 
      the database (your 4+4 and password entered correctly) you are presented 
      with this top menu:</font></p>
      <p align="center">
      <img border="1" src="toppage.jpg" width="393" height="225"></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Under the left-side heading &quot;<b>Go 
      directly to a specific product</b>,&quot; click on the line labeled &quot;<b>ISI Web 
      of Science</b>.&quot;</font><br>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As indicated in the graphic

      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">That takes you to another 
      display, where you will indicate that you are going to be using the part 
      of the ISI database that specifies its social sciences database, &quot;<b>Social 
      Sciences Citation Index</b>,&quot; and that you wish to carry out a &quot;<b>Cited 
      Ref Search</b>&quot;-- a cited reference search.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="center">
      <img border="1" src="fullsearchpage.jpg" width="393" height="307"></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After clicking on &quot;Cited 
      Reference Search,&quot; this display comes up:</font></p>
      <p align="center">
      <img border="1" src="searchscreen.jpg" width="347" height="244"></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You are going to use two areas 
      on this display:</font><ol>
        <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">the &quot;Lookup&quot; button</font></li>
        <li>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">the &quot;CITED AUTHOR&quot; fill-in box</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The first thing you should do 
      is formulate the cited author specification, and we will talk about that 
      process in a moment.&nbsp; But, lets say, without explanation, that you 
      already know of an author and a work that you wish to &quot;trace forward&quot; 
      through citation indexing to see what other journal articles have used 
      this earlier work.&nbsp; As an example, there is a book by the American 
      pollster, Daniel Yankelovich, called <i><b>Coming to Public Judgement</b></i>.&nbsp;
      </font>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We can use ISI's <i><b>Web of 
      Science</b></i> citation indexing service to see if there are any later 
      journal articles that have made reference to (cited, used, etc.) his work, 
      which we know was published in 1991 (Syracuse University Press).</font><p align="left">
      <font face="Arial" size="2">What we would do, then, is enter this 
      expression in the &quot;CITED AUTHOR&quot; box:</font><blockquote>
        <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><font size="2" face="Courier New">
      yankelovich</font><font size="2" face="Courier New"> d*</font></font></blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">What this expression tells the 
      ISI system is to look for all cited references that have the author whose 
      last name is &quot;yankelovich&quot; and whose first name begins with a &quot;d.&quot;&nbsp; 
      You see, ISI doesn't construct author names in the more standard format of 
      last name, comma, first name, (and sometimes) middle name or initial.&nbsp; 
      Instead, it uses last name, a space, and a first initial, (and sometimes) 
      a middle initial too.&nbsp; So by using the asterisk (*), we are denoting 
      truncation or the &quot;wild-card symbol&quot; of any other letter that might occur 
      in authors' names after the &quot;d.&quot;</font><p align="left">
      <font face="Arial" size="2">At any rate, what we get as a response from 
      the <i><b>Web of Science</b></i> system is several pages of results that 
      all fit our search specification.&nbsp; The first page of the results 
      looks like this:</font><p align="center">
      <img border="1" src="yank1.jpg" width="467" height="488"><p align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial">If you notice, the citations are organized 
      alphabetically by the third column, the &quot;name&quot; of the cited work.&nbsp; 
      This is the column we are interested in looking in to find something 
      similar to &quot;coming to public judgement,&quot; the title of the book Yankelovich 
      authored in 1991.&nbsp; </font>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Before clicking on the next 
      display page (the &quot;2&quot; along the display page bar across the top and bottom 
      of each display page), take a look at the separate entries on each line of 
      this display page.&nbsp; The &quot;Hits&quot; column records the number of journal 
      articles in the ISI database that have cited a particular publication 
      written by Yankelovich.&nbsp; So, for example, the ISI database has 9 
      articles indexed that cited something by Yankelovich which is indicated by 
      the shortened title, &quot;Beltway Engaging Pub,&quot; whatever that is.</font><p align="left">
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Also note that the amount of information per 
      entry given to you in the ISI database is very, very minimal (skimpy, 
      shortened, abbreviated).&nbsp; As you will see when you use this service, 
      you must know enough about what a previously published work's author name 
      is, and what the title was of the work, and when it appeared, in order to 
      make effective use of the service.&nbsp; The entries just doesn't 
      overwhelm the user with detail: the user has to know those details.</font><p align="left">
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Lastly, note that there is a check box on the 
      left side of each line.&nbsp; If you decide you are interested in seeing 
      what the journal article's are that cited a particular Yankelovich entry 
      (book or article), click that box on.&nbsp; Later, when you have finished 
      noting what you want to see, you will click the &quot;<b>SEARCH</b>&quot; button, &quot;<b>to 
      find articles that cite selected reference</b>.&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="2" face="Arial">First, though, we need to click through to the 
      next page (page 2) to see if our Yankolovich publication, <i><b>Coming to 
      Public Judgment</b></i>, appears there.&nbsp; As it turns out, it does:</font><p align="center">
      <img border="1" src="yank2.jpg" width="467" height="442"><p align="left">
      <font face="Arial" size="2">You can see that there are a variety of 
      entries that resemble our book, Coming to Public Judgement.&nbsp; Why the 
      differences?&nbsp; Well, ISI hires staff members to input this information 
      directly from the new journal articles going into the ISI database, with 
      no &quot;authority control&quot; work being done.&nbsp; So, if an author's name is 
      spelled out with a middle initial in one journal article, but without in 
      another, that is the what the staff members of ISI use in inputting the 
      author's name.&nbsp; If an author makes a mistake on citing Yankolovich's 
      book, saying it was published in 1974, that is what the ISI staffers will 
      use.&nbsp; Notice, if you will, that on this page alone, ISI has what 
      looks like the Coming to Public Judgement book as being published in 1991, 
      1988, and 1994!&nbsp; And we haven't even looked at the next page, where 
      there are probably more entried indicating some more journal articles that 
      were citing Yankelovich's book, <b>Coming to Public Judgement</b>.&nbsp; 
      Just be forewarned: ISI is very, very bad about quality control over its 
      entries.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Without looking 
      on page 4 to see if there are more entries referring to the Yankelovich 
      book, lets now decide what entries we wish to have the ISI system work 
      with for us.&nbsp; As you can see below, we have clicked on 8 entries, one 
      of which was clearly the usually-used (or &quot;correct&quot;) format of citing this 
      book: it was used 28 times.&nbsp; At any rate, we have indicated that we 
      wish for ISI to show us 35 journal article records that all have cited the 
      Yankelovich book, <i><b>Coming to Public Judgement</b></i>.</font><p align="center">
      <img border="1" src="yank3.jpg" width="467" height="431"><p align="left">
      <font face="Arial" size="2">To do that, all we need do is click on the &quot;SEARH&quot; 
      button.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">When we do that, 
      this is the beginning results page that ISI gives us:</font><p align="center">

      <font size="2" face="Arial">These article titles may each be clicked on to

      <img border="1" src="maxwellarticle.jpg" width="475" height="677"><p align="left">
      <font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;Of course, the more recent the article
